# Learn from courses

## 01. [Launching into Machine Learning](https://github.com/thien1892/learn_from_courses/tree/master/Launching%20into%20Machine%20Learning)
- Time: 4 days
- Link: [Click](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/8)
- Organization: Google Cloud Skills Boost
- Main content: 
    - The course begins with a discussion about data: how to improve data quality and perform exploratory data analysis. 
    - We describe Vertex AI AutoML and how to build, train, and deploy an ML model without writing a single line of code.  
    - You will understand the benefits of Big Query ML. 
    - We then discuss how to optimize a machine learning (ML) model and how generalization and sampling can help assess the quality of ML models for custom training.

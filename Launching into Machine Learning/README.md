# Intro
- The course begins with a discussion about data: how to improve data quality and perform exploratory data analysis.
- We describe Vertex AI AutoML and how to build, train, and deploy an ML model without writing a single line of code.
- You will understand the benefits of Big Query ML.
- We then discuss how to optimize a machine learning (ML) model and how generalization and sampling can help assess the quality of ML models for custom training

# Content
## 1. [Using BigQuery ML to Predict Penguin Weight](https://github.com/thien1892/learn_from_courses/blob/master/Launching%20into%20Machine%20Learning/BigQueryML.md)
- Create a linear regression model using the CREATE MODEL statement with BigQuery ML.

- Evaluate the ML model with the ML.EVALUATE function.

- Make predictions using the ML model with the ML.PREDICT function.

## 2. [Using the BigQuery ML Hyperparameter Tuning to Improve Model Performance](https://github.com/thien1892/learn_from_courses/blob/master/Launching%20into%20Machine%20Learning/BigQueryML.md)
- Create a linear regression model using the CREATE MODEL statement with the num_trials set to 20.

- Check the overview of all 20 trials using the ML.TRIAL_INFO function.

- Evaluate the ML model using the ML.EVALUATE function.

- Make predictions using the ML model and ML.PREDICT function.

# Intro
- The course begins with a discussion about data: how to improve data quality and perform exploratory data analysis.
- We describe Vertex AI AutoML and how to build, train, and deploy an ML model without writing a single line of code.
- You will understand the benefits of Big Query ML.
- We then discuss how to optimize a machine learning (ML) model and how generalization and sampling can help assess the quality of ML models for custom training

# 3. BigQuery Machine Learning: Develop ML Models Where Your Data Lives
